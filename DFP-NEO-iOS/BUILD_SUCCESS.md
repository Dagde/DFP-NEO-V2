# 🎉 Build Success Guide

## ✅ All Files Fixed:

- Ready to build and install!

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Build the app (should work now)
2. Install on iPhone
3. Test login screen
4. Add DFP-NEO logo
5. Connect to backend API

## 📱 Test Credentials:
- User ID: ADMIN001
- Password: ChangeMe123!

## 🔧 If Build Fails:
- Check bundle identifier is unique
- Ensure iPhone is trusted
- Make sure Face ID capability is added

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:
- App should open to black login screen
- DFP-NEO logo placeholder visible
- Login form with metallic text fields
- Face ID button if available on device
