## If you see "Cannot find type 'XXX' in scope":
- Usually missing import statement

## If you see "Use of undeclared type 'XXX'":
- Usually a typo or missing file reference
- Check spelling of class names

## If you see "Cannot find 'AuthService' in scope":
- Missing service file or incorrect import
- Easy to fix with proper import

## Expected Issues:
- API connection errors (backend not ready yet)
- Missing logo image (we'll add this)
- Network permission errors (App Transport Security)

## Don't worry about these - they're normal!
The app should build and install, then we can fix functionality step by step.
