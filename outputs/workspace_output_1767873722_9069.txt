(node:1541) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///workspace/dfp-neo-platform/import_scores_to_db.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /workspace/dfp-neo-platform/package.json.
