# Staff Page Combined Data Integration

## Planning
[x] Examine current Staff page (InstructorListView) implementation
[x] Examine StaffCombinedDataTable to understand data fetching logic
[x] Understand current organization structure (Unit → Rank → Alphabetical)

## Implementation
[x] Update InstructorListView to fetch combined data instead of ESL_DATA.instructors
[x] Ensure combined data is organized by Unit, then Rank, then Alphabetical
[ ] Test the updated Staff page with combined data
[ ] Rebuild the application
[ ] Copy build artifacts to public directory
[ ] Commit and push changes
