## 📋 Quick Reference: The 5 Environment Variables

```
1. DATABASE_URL
   Where: Get from PostgreSQL service in Railway
   Format: postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway
   Purpose: Connect to shared database

2. NEXTAUTH_URL
   Where: Copy from your website's Railway URL after deployment
   Format: https://your-website-url.up.railway.app
   Purpose: NextAuth configuration

3. NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   Where: Generate it yourself
   Command: openssl rand -base64 32
   Purpose: Authentication security

4. NEXT_PUBLIC_FLIGHT_SCHOOL_URL
   Where: Your existing DFP-NEO Railway URL
   Format: https://dfp-neo-production.up.railway.app
   Purpose: Redirect to Flight School app

5. NEXT_PUBLIC_RECONNAISSANCE_URL
   Where: Your existing DFP-NEO-V2 Railway URL
   Format: https://dfp-neo-neo-v2-production.up.railway.app

## 🔍 Step 2 Quick Reference (Modifying DFP-NEO)

### Identify Your App Type:
```
Run: cat package.json

If you see "next" → It's Next.js → Follow CLEAR_STEP2_EXPLANATION.md → Next.js section
If you see "react" → It's React → Follow CLEAR_STEP2_EXPLANATION.md → React section
If you see neither → It's HTML → Follow CLEAR_STEP2_EXROMATION.md → HTML section
```

### Find the Main File:
```
Next.js: app/page.tsx OR pages/index.tsx
React: src/App.tsx OR src/App.js
HTML: index.html
```

### Remove:
```
- Login page references
- Authentication checks (if statements)
- User/session state
- Auth imports

KEEP: FlightSchool component (but show it directly)
```
