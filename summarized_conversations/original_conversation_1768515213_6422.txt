The app needs to:\n1. Link User records to Personnel records by PMKEYS/idNumber\n2. Fetch military rank from Personnel table, not User table\n3. Properly delete Personnel records when removed from UI\n4. Clean up duplicate Personnel records\n\n### Solutions Implemented\n\n#### 1. Fixed Rank Display (`/api/user/personnel/route.ts`)\n**Commit**: `6ee9355`\n- Endpoint finds ALL Personnel records matching by idNumber (PMKEYS)\n- Prioritizes records with `userId` set (properly linked to User table)\n- Falls back to most recently created record if no linked record exists\n- Logs all duplicate records for debugging\n\n#### 2. Added CRUD Endpoints for Personnel (`/api/personnel/[id]/route.ts`)\n**Commit**: `f72a966`\n- **DELETE** endpoint: Fully deletes Personnel records from database\n- **PATCH** endpoint: Updates Personnel records\n- Both require authentication and log all actions for audit trail\n\n#### 3. Created Duplicate Cleanup Tool (`/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates`)\n**Commit**: `f72a966`\n- Automatically finds and removes duplicate Personnel records\n- Keeps records with `userId` set (properly linked)\n- Falls back to most recently created record\n- Provides detailed cleanup report\n\n#### 4. Created Admin Dashboard (`/admin/database`)\n**Commits**: `6107551`, `d811b53`\n- Only accessible to ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN users\n- **Overview Tab**: Database statistics, recent activity, duplicate warnings\n- **SQL Query Tab**: Execute READ-ONLY SQL queries directly\n- **Duplicates Tab**: View and cleanup duplicate Personnel records\n- Modern UI with lucide-react icons\n\n### Debug Endpoints Created\n1. `/api/debug/user-personnel-linkage` - Shows User-Personnel linkage status\n2. `/api/debug/database-connection` - Shows database connection and Alexander Burns\' data\n3. `/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates` - Cleans up duplicate Personnel records\n\n### Database Access Options\n1. **Railway Dashboard** (recommended): https://railway.app → PostgreSQL service\n2. **Railway CLI**: `railway db` command\n3. **Admin Dashboard**: `https://dfp-neo.com/admin/database` (ADMIN only)\n\n### Files Modified\n1. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/user/personnel/route.ts` - Fixed rank display logic\n2. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/personnel/[id]/route.ts` - Added DELETE and PATCH endpoints\n3. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates/route.ts` - New cleanup endpoint\n4. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/admin/database/route.ts` - New admin API endpoint\n5. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/admin/database/page.tsx` - New admin dashboard UI\n6. `/workspace/DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive documentation\n\n### Deployment Status\n- **Latest commit**: `d811b53` - "fix: Add missing properties to RecentItem interface"\n- **Status**: Successfully pushed to GitHub, Railway deploying (5-10 minutes)\n- **Build errors encountered and fixed**:\n  - Missing lucide-react package → Installed\n  - TypeScript errors with RecentItem interface → Added `role` and `idNumber` properties\n\n### Testing Instructions (When Returning)\n1. Wait for Railway to deploy commit `d811b53`\n2. Log in as Alexander Burns\n3. Verify rank shows as "SQNLDR" (not "INSTRUCTOR" or "FLTLT")\n4. Check console logs for duplicate record warnings\n5. Log in as ADMIN and test the new `/admin/database` dashboard\n6. Use cleanup tool to remove duplicate Personnel records\n7. Verify duplicate Personnel records are removed from database\n8. Test DELETE endpoint functionality (deleting staff from UI removes from DB)\n\n### Known Issues\n- Duplicate Personnel records still exist in database (cleanup tool created but not run)\n- Rank display may still show incorrect values if Personnel record not properly linked\n- No automatic cleanup of duplicates - requires manual admin action\n\n### Next Steps (When Returning)\n1. Test that rank display now shows "SQNLDR" for Alexander Burns\n2. Access `/admin/database` dashboard as ADMIN\n3. Run duplicate cleanup tool to remove duplicate Personnel records\n4. Verify database now has only one record per staff member\n5. Test DELETE functionality removes records from database\n6. Verify User-Personnel linkage works for new staff creation\n\n### Documentation\n- `/workspace/DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Complete database management documentation\n\n---\n\n## PINNED SOLUTION: Rank Display Shows "Instructor" Instead of Military Rank\n\n### Problem\nDashboard shows "Instructor" instead of actual military rank (e.g., "SQNLDR") for logged-in users.\n\n### Root Cause\nThe app was displaying the User table `role` field ("INSTRUCTOR") instead of fetching the military `rank` field from the Personnel table.\n\n### Solution\n1.

The app needs to:\n- Link User records to Personnel records by PMKEYS/idNumber\n- Fetch military rank from Personnel table, not User table\n- Properly delete Personnel records when removed from UI\n- Clean up duplicate Personnel records\n\n### Solutions Implemented\n\n#### 1. Fixed Rank Display (`/api/user/personnel/route.ts`)\n**Commit**: `6ee9355`\n- Endpoint finds ALL Personnel records matching by idNumber (PMKEYS)\n- Prioritizes records with `userId` set (properly linked to User table)\n- Falls back to most recently created record if no linked record exists\n- Logs all duplicate records for debugging\n\n#### 2. Added CRUD Endpoints for Personnel (`/api/personnel/[id]/route.ts`)\n**Commit**: `f72a966`\n- **DELETE** endpoint: Fully deletes Personnel records from database\n- **PATCH** endpoint: Updates Personnel records\n- Both require authentication and log all actions for audit trail\n\n#### 3. Created Duplicate Cleanup Tool (`/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates`)\n**Commit**: `f72a966`\n- Automatically finds and removes duplicate Personnel records\n- Keeps records with `userId` set (properly linked)\n- Falls back to most recently created record\n- Provides detailed cleanup report\n\n#### 4. Created Admin Dashboard (`/admin/database`)\n**Commits**: `6107551`, `d811b53`\n- Only accessible to ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN users\n- **Overview Tab**: Database statistics, recent activity, duplicate warnings\n- **SQL Query Tab**: Execute READ-ONLY SQL queries directly\n- **Duplicates Tab**: View and cleanup duplicate Personnel records\n- Modern UI with lucide-react icons\n\n### Debug Endpoints Created\n\n1. `/api/debug/user-personnel-linkage` - Shows User-Personnel linkage status\n2. `/api/debug/database-connection` - Shows database connection and Alexander Burns\' data\n3. `/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates` - Cleans up duplicate Personnel records\n\n### Database Access Options\n\n1. **Railway Dashboard** (recommended): https://railway.app → PostgreSQL service\n2. **Railway CLI**: `railway db` command\n3. **Admin Dashboard**: `https://dfp-neo.com/admin/database` (ADMIN only)\n\n### Files Modified\n\n1. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/user/personnel/route.ts` - Fixed rank display logic\n2. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/personnel/[id]/route.ts` - Added DELETE and PATCH endpoints\n3. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/debug/cleanup-duplicates/route.ts` - New cleanup endpoint\n4. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/api/admin/database/route.ts` - New admin API endpoint\n5. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/app/admin/database/page.tsx` - New admin dashboard UI\n6. `/workspace/DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive documentation\n\n### Deployment Status\n\n- **Latest commit**: `d811b53`\n- **Status**: Successfully pushed to GitHub, Railway deploying (5-10 minutes)\n- **Build errors encountered and fixed**:\n  - Missing lucide-react package → Installed\n  - TypeScript errors with RecentItem interface → Added `role` and `idNumber` properties\n\n### Testing Instructions (When Returning)\n\n1. Wait for Railway to deploy commit `d811b53`\n2. Log in as Alexander Burns\n3. Verify rank shows as "SQNLDR" (not "INSTRUCTOR" or "FLTLT")\n4. Check console logs for duplicate record warnings\n5. Log in as ADMIN and test the new `/admin/database` dashboard\n6. Use cleanup tool to remove duplicate Personnel records\n7. Verify duplicate Personnel records are removed from database\n8. Test DELETE endpoint functionality (deleting staff from UI removes from DB)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n- Duplicate Personnel records still exist in database (cleanup tool created but not run)\n- Rank display may still show incorrect values if Personnel record not properly linked\n- No automatic cleanup of duplicates - requires manual admin action\n\n### Next Steps (When Returning)\n\n1. Test that rank display now shows "SQNLDR" for Alexander Burns\n2. Access `/admin/database` dashboard as ADMIN\n3. Run duplicate cleanup tool to remove duplicate Personnel records\n4. Verify database now has only one record per staff member\n5. Test DELETE functionality removes records from database\n6. Verify User-Personnel linkage works for new staff creation\n\n### Documentation\n\n- `/workspace/DATABASE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Complete database management documentation\n\nEOF\n</execute-command>\n</function_calls>'}

Display OFI staff in their own column\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `/workspace/components/InstructorListView.tsx` - Add OFI column and filtering logic\n- `/workspace/App.tsx` - Ensure database staff are loaded into instructorsData state\n\n## Status\n- [x] Identified the issue\n- [ ] Modify InstructorListView.tsx to add OFI filtering\n- [ ] Add OFI column display\n- [ ] Test that Alexander Burns appears in Staff Roster</new_str>\n</str-replace>\n</function_calls>'}

Total instructors: Y (mockdata: A + database: B)\n```\n\n## Testing Instructions\n\n1. **Wait for Railway deployment** (5-10 minutes)\n2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)\n3. **Navigate to Staff Roster page**\n4. **Verify Alexander Burns appears** in the OFIs column\n5. **Check console logs** for database staff loading messages\n6. **Verify total instructor count** includes both mockdata and database staff\n\n## Files Modified\n\n1. `/workspace/components/InstructorListView.tsx`\n   - Added `ofis` useMemo hook (line 158)\n   - Added OFI column JSX (after SIM IP column)\n\n2. `/workspace/App.tsx`\n   - Added database staff loading useEffect (after line 3199)\n\n3. `/workspace/dfp-neo-platform/public/flight-school-app/`\n   - Updated build artifacts (index-Dlo69Sjm.js)\n\n## Commit Information\n\n**Commit:** `0fcf44e`  \n**Message:** "feat: Add OFI column to Staff Roster and merge database staff"  \n**Branch:** `feature/comprehensive-build-algorithm`\n\n## Key Features\n\n✅ OFI staff filtering (role=\'OFI\' || isOFI=true)  \n✅ Purple-themed OFI column display  \n✅ Database staff fetching from `/api/personnel`  \n✅ Automatic merging with mockdata  \n✅ Duplicate removal by idNumber  \n✅ Console logging for debugging  \n✅ Backward compatible with existing mockdata  \n\n## Related Issues\n\nThis implementation addresses the requirement:\n> "All Staff in the database that have a QFI or SIM IP role are to be included in the Staff Roster page with the Mock data"\n\nNow extended to include OFI staff as well.\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## ✅ Implementation Complete: OFI Column Added to Staff Roster\n\n### Problem Solved\nAlexander Burns (SQNLDR, PMKEYS 8201112) was in the database with role='OFI' but was **NOT** appearing in the Staff Roster page because:\n1. Staff Roster only showed QFI and SIM IP columns\n2. Database staff were not being loaded into the application\n3. Only mockdata instructors were displayed\n\n### Solution Implemented\n\n#### 1. **Added OFI Column to Staff Roster** ✅\n- **File:** `/workspace/components/InstructorListView.tsx`\n- Added filtering logic: `role === 'OFI' || isOFI === true`\n- Added new purple-themed OFI column alongside QFI and SIM IP columns\n- Alexander Burns will now appear in the OFIs column\n\n#### 2. **Implemented Database Staff Loading** ✅\n- **File:** `/workspace/App.tsx`\n- Added useEffect to fetch all staff from `/api/personnel` endpoint\n- Converts database personnel to Instructor format\n- **Merges** database staff with mockdata\n- Removes duplicates by PMKEYS (idNumber)\n- Console logs for debugging and verification\n\n### What Happens Now\n\n**On App Load:**\n1. Mockdata instructors load initially (ESL_DATA.instructors)\n2. useEffect fetches database staff from `/api/personnel`\n3. Database staff are converted to Instructor format\n4. Database staff are merged with mockdata (no duplicates)\n5. Staff Roster displays **all** staff:\n   - Mockdata QFIs → QFI columns\n   - Mockdata SIM IPs → SIM IP column\n   - Database QFIs → QFI columns\n   - Database SIM IPs → SIM IP column\n   - Database OFIs → **NEW OFI column** (purple)\n\n### Expected Results After Railway Deployment\n\n**Staff Roster Page Structure:**\n```\n┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐\n│   1FTS      │    CFS      │  SIM IPs    │    OFIs     │\n│  (14 QFIs)  │   (5 QFIs)  │    (4)      │   (NEW)     │\n│             │             │             │             │\n│ - Davies, J │ - Lee, M    │ - Green, O  │ - Burns, A  │ ← Alexander\n│ - Dyne, D   │ - Bloggs, J │ - Hall, E   │             │   Burns!\n│ - Dene, D   │ - Mitchell  │ - Parker, J │             │\n│ ...         │ ...         │ ...         │             │\n└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘\n```\n\n**Console Logs:**\n```\n🔍 [DATABASE STAFF] Fetching database staff...\n📊 [DATABASE STAFF] Found X database staff records\n📋 [DATABASE STAFF] Database instructors: [...]\n✅ [DATABASE STAFF] Merged!

Once Railway finishes deploying, Alexander Burns should be visible in the Staff Roster page!\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n</complete>\n</function_calls>"}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Perfect! I\'ve added a cache-busting timestamp to force the browser to load the new JavaScript file. Here\'s what happened and what you need to do:\n\n## 🎯 Problem Identified\n\n**Issue:** Browser is caching the old JavaScript file (`index-BPhtDnbW.js`) instead of loading the new one (`index-C7LH4A6u.js`) with the data trackers.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Console logs show `index-BPhtDnbW.js` (old file)\n- No tracker messages appeared (`[DATABASE STAFF]`, `[OFI FILTER]`, etc.)\n- HTML file correctly references `index-C7LH4A6u.js`\n\n## ✅ Solution Applied\n\nAdded cache-busting timestamp to the HTML file:\n```html\n<!-- Before -->\n<script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-C7LH4A6u.js"></script>\n\n<!-- After -->\n<script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-C7LH4A6u.js?v=1768509156"></script>\n```\n\nThe `?v=1768509156` parameter forces the browser to treat this as a new file and bypass any cached version.\n\n## 📝 Testing Instructions\n\n1. **Wait for Railway deployment** (5-10 minutes) - commit `daaee66`\n2. **Hard refresh browser** - **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)\n   - This is CRITICAL - regular refresh won\'t work\n3. **Open Staff Roster page**\n4. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) → **Console tab**\n5. **Look for tracker messages:**\n\n### Expected Console Output\n\n```\n🔍 [DATABASE STAFF] Fetching database staff...\n📊 [DATABASE STAFF] Raw API response: {...}\n📊 [DATABASE STAFF] Found X database staff records\n📊 [DATABASE STAFF] Raw personnel data sample: [...]\n📋 [DATABASE STAFF] Database instructors: [...]\n✅ [DATABASE STAFF] Merged! Total instructors: Y (mockdata: A + database: B)\n🔍 [OFI FILTER] instructorsData length: Y\n🔍 [OFI FILTER] Checking Burns, Alexander: role="OFI", isOFI=true, isOfi=true\n🔍 [OFI FILTER] OFI candidates found: X\n🔍 [OFI FILTER] Final OFI list: [...]\n```\n\n6. **Check the Staff Roster page** - Alexander Burns should appear in the **OFIs** column (purple)\n\n## 🔍 What the Trackers Will Tell Us\n\nOnce you see the console logs, we\'ll know exactly what\'s happening:\n\n- **If `[DATABASE STAFF] Found 0 records`** → API returns empty data\n- **If `[DATABASE STAFF] Failed to fetch`** → API endpoint issue\n- **If `OFI candidates found: 0`** → Alexander Burns not marked as OFI in database\n- **If `Final OFI list: [...]` includes Burns** → SUCCESS! 🎉\n\nPlease try the hard refresh and share the new console logs with me!\n\n**Commit:** `daaee66` - "fix: Add cache-busting timestamp to force browser to load new JavaScript"\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n</complete>\n</function_calls>'}
